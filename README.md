# Solution Overview

## Setting Up the Environment
- Ensure Python is installed in the development environment.
- Install the necessary libraries, such as `pact-python`, for creating contracts and writing tests.

## Implementing the Employee Service
- Develop the Employee service with endpoints to create, update, and retrieve employee details.
- Verify that the service functions correctly and returns the expected responses.

## Implementing the Dashboard Service
- Develop the Dashboard service that exposes APIs to HRs and internally calls the Employee service APIs.
- Ensure seamless integration between the Dashboard service and the Employee service.

## Creating Contracts with Pact-Python
- Utilize the `pact-python` library to generate contracts for both services: Dashboard and Employee.
- Define the interactions between the consumer (Dashboard) and the provider (Employee) in the contracts.

## Writing Test Cases
- Write comprehensive test cases to ensure adherence to the contracts.
- Verify that the consumer contract for the Dashboard service is a subset of the provider contract for the Employee service.
- Ensure that the consumer contract is created only if the provider contract exists; otherwise, the test should fail.
- Update the contract immediately upon changes in provider APIs and validate it against the consumer contract.

## Testing and Validation
- Execute the test cases to ensure compliance with the contract requirements.
- Verify that any changes in the provider APIs are reflected in the contracts and do not break the consumer contract.
- Make necessary adjustments to the contracts and tests to maintain compatibility between the services.

By following these steps systematically, one can effectively solve the problem outlined in the problem statement. Clear documentation will aid in understanding and maintaining the solution in the future.
